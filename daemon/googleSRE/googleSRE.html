                Paying homage to who many consider to be at the forefront of distributed systems,
                I have deciced to review and reflect on some of the concepts put forth in the O'Reilly book, <i>
                <a style="color:#9C6708;" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html" target="_blank">
                Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems</a></i>. This work will be done
                concurrently with my development of a distributed system for graph storage, to help foster
                both projects, and I have attached a link to that source code at the bottom of this introduction.
                For those readers who are just now hearing about Site Reliability Engineering,
                SRE is Google's approach to how they develop and manage their internet services like Gmail,
                Maps, and Drive. When Benjamin Sloss joined Google in 2003 and ran a "Production Team" of seven
                other engineers, he decided to manage the group through software engineering tenants that he had
                picked up over his years of previous work. Over time, this team and these tenants matured
                into what is Google's present-day SRE team. One of the first major drives of any Site Reliability
                Engineer should be to automate as many of their work processes as they can, so as to minimize on the
                amount of actual "complex manual labor" they have to actually perform.
