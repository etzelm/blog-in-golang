                Collaborating on this project with me is my former distributed systems classmate, <a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://github.com/bryandmc" target="_blank">Bryan McCoid</a>. Our inspiration for this project was 
                a desire to recreate some of our coursework, created by <a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://github.com/palvaro" target="_blank">Peter Alvaro</a> of <a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://disorderlylabs.github.io/" target="_blank">Disorderly Labs</a>, for public view and to do 
                so by completely starting from scratch in order to implement algorithms that we had wanted to use during the 
                course but had ran out of time to do so. Several attempts at academic honesty have been made and we also 
                strongly discourage any current students who happen upon this content from using it in their own coursework, 
                not only because you will be caught but because you are depriving yourself of the education you pay for. 
                Bryan and I are aspiring Software Engineers and we take this project on in the hope of developing and 
                improving the skills needed to be successful in industry, especially when it comes to dealing with 
                distributed systems.  
                </p>

                <p>
                The goal of the project is to provide a REST-accessible graph storage service that 
                runs on port 3000 and is available as a resource named gs. For example, the service would listen at 
                <a style="color:#9C6708;" href="http://server-hostname:3000/gs" target="_blank">
                http://server-hostname:3000/gs</a>. We want to develop distributed system software to support this service so 
                that it can store an amount of data that would not normally fit onto a single machine system. To accomplish 
                this, we will simulate our server code as if it is being run on multiple, separate hosts simultaneously, 
                using Docker to provide this functionality. A single server host in our system stores only a certain subset 
                of the graphs stored in the system as a whole. We also have them keep track of a list of all the other server 
                hostnames in the known system so that they can forward requests they receive for graphs that aren't stored 
                locally for them. The plan is to distribute graphs among partitions that each have an active amount of server 
                hosts assigned to them based on the total number of server hosts that exist in the system at the time of 
                observation. This way each server host in a partition can store the same subset of graphs assigned to that 
                partition, providing a measurable amount of fault-tolerance to the user if one of those hosts happens to 
                crash or experience a network partition.
                </p>

                <p>
                Scalability is achieved by allowing for the user to change the system environment by adding or removing 
                server hosts, based on their needs, using API calls which then have our distributed system software 
                automatically reshuffle our partitioning and graph distribution across all active server hosts to attain 
                maximum fault-tolerance and minimize access latency. To ensure strong consistency among server hosts in 
                a partition that stores the same subset of graphs in our system, we will use an algorithm called Raft that 
                uses a 2 phase commit sequence and timers to achieve consensus on a total causal order over any value given 
                to us by the user. Due to the CAP theorem, we know that using partitions to attain fault tolerance means we 
                cannot have a graph store that is both highly available and strongly consistent. In this project, we will 
                favor strong consistency over having our system be highly available, meaning our service should only return 
                responses to requests if it can guarantee that it is using the most recent data available to it.
