                Five Talent, an Effectual Company, has weekly company wide catered lunches where people are given the 
                opportunity to present on interesting topics that are relevant to the contracts they're currently 
                working on. I took the option to give a presentation on Amazon Web Service's Elastic Map Reduce 
                offering as the migration I spent the first 5 month's of my employment working on was heavily reliant 
                on taking the client's Hadoop based SaaS product and getting it to work on EMR. Please find the slides

                This AWS service is a dynamically scale-able, big data processing distributed system provider based on 
                several open source Apache libraries like Spark, Hadoop, Hive, HBase, and Zookeeper. Itâ€™s used to store, 
                manipulate, and reduce large scale data sets to help provide new context, understanding, and insights 
                into what the data means. For a long-time, big data users of these technologies have been locked into 
                expensive, long-term hardware contracts with their data-center providers for the amount of servers they 
                think they need at the time of the original signing. Below are some extracts from my original set of 
                PowerPoint slides, click/touch the images to see the next.

                Amazon Web Services' EMR brings Industry Leading Technologies out of rigid on-premise data-centers 
                and into the affordable, scalable Cloud. Now that the necessary technologies are managed by AWS, 
                these same expensive, "on-prem", data center customers get the cost savings and scalability of 
                ephemeral EC2 clusters as well as the reliability of S3/EBS storage. Amazon currently sells it as:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    Petabyte-scale analysis at less than half of the cost of traditional on-premises solutions and 
                    over 3x faster than standard Apache Spark. For short-running jobs, you can spin up and spin down 
                    clusters and pay per second for the instances used. For long-running workloads, you can create 
                    highly available clusters that automatically scale to meet demand.
