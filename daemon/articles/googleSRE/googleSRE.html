                Most people who have worked as or around Software Engineers can probably easily identify those fishy 
                smells which permeate a company poorly implementing Agile and SCRUM work methodologies. Decomposing 
                piles of bugs, issues, and tasks being carried over from one sprint to another, most without any prospect 
                of being closed or completed in the near future. Surely there would be a connection between these leftovers 
                and the over-arching feature plans for the company product, or at the least those plans and how the sprints 
                are being laid out to the developers. Paying homage to who many consider to be at the forefront of distributed 
                system development, I'm going to tell you about some of the best ways I've found to internalize the most 
                important lessons put forth in the O'Reilly book, <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering: How Google 
                Runs Production Systems</a></i>. Hopefully with better versions of these tools under your tool belt, we can 
                all work together to make sure our office spaces don't end up smelling like Fisherman's Warf in San Francisco.

                    In a legacy corporate environment where software engineers develop binaries and throw them over the wall 
                    to the administrators who update the servers, segregation of testing infrastructure and production 
                    configuration is at best annoying, and at worst can damage reliability and agility.

                <h2 class="center-text">Lesson One: Cooperation & Collaboration</h2><br>

                <p>
                Testing is one of (if not) the most important things a company and its developers can do to ensure the long 
                term viability of the product(s) it makes. Developers and their managers are at their best when working in a 
                spirit of cooperation with the coworkers they will be handing over their labor too. With that being said, I 
                believe a good chunk of us understand from experience that this isn't always the easiest thing to accomplish. 
                Pride in one's work can be a good thing but it shouldn't come at the cost of cooperating with one's colleagues.
                When collaboration stops, people can start to segregate testing infrastructure and production configurations 
                in the hopes that it serves their own agendas against a perceived internal "competitor" instead of leaving the 
                focus on the external customer. As the quote above goes to show, this segregation can start to damage 
                customers' perception of company and product reliability.
                </p>

                <p>
                Creating preemptive routines that are consistent and repetitive is one of the best ways I've found to 
                internalize this cooperative lesson I'm spouting. Testing plans should not be started when the developers 
                are "finished" with their product and ready to hand it over, the perfect time to start designing tests is 
                when you're designing the product. A preemptive set of meetings with testers as a new part of the product 
                is growing is an amazing way for developers to bring everyone onto the same page and help data retention. 
                Three one-hour meetings over three months is way better than one three-hour "handover" meeting where 
                developers can get more defensive over any slight issue or misunderstanding.

                <h2 class="center-text">Lesson Two: Release Engineering</h2><br>

                <p>
                Planning and adhearing to the policies and procedures for releasing a project are some of the most important 
                things product owners can do, especially in regards to approving source code changes for production 
                environments. Sadly at smaller companies, some of the worst and more frequent offenders of both tend to be the 
                people who are supposed to enforce the rules themselves. In the section entitled 'Enforcement of Policies and 
                Procedures' on page 89, I think it's best to point out that the code review process is streamlined to the point 
                of allowing Goolge SREs to know what changes are included in a new release/build of a project and why they are 
                there. This can help to keep everyone honest and save time in several trouble-shooting scenarios. Internalizing 
                this lesson is all about self-control and my preferred way to achieve this is effective discipline, without 
                it there is little in the way of power struggles or authority complexes causing all sorts of trouble.

                <h2 class="center-text">Lesson Three: Post Mortem Culture</h2><br>

                <p>
                Blameless Post Mortem Culture is my favorite of the three lessons I'm discussing in this post. On page 170, 
                Google is serious when they say that if a culture of finger pointing and shaming individuals or teams for 
                doing the "wrong" thing prevails, people will not bring issues to light for fear of punishment. A company is 
                often only as strong as its product(s) and if issues continue to pile up in the dark than what does that 
                signal about the health of the company? I think as individuals in the industry it can sometimes be tough to 
                remember that there are two sides to this lesson. One side is internalizing the humility it takes to be able 
                to silently accept responibility for any of your mistakes while trying to diagnose and discuss the root causes 
                of what went wrong. The other side of the lesson is internalizing humility for people when its their mistakes, 
                especially when things get difficult and they aren't showing much, if any, humility themselves. The greatest 
                stepping stone I've found for gaining humility is being able recognize my own faults and accept that I 
                can't realistically be the best at everything I do. It's better to view each moment as a chance to better 
                myself, rather than a competition to be won.
