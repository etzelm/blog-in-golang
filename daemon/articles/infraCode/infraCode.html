                What’s with all the hype around Infrastructure as Code? Well Amazon wrote half of the tools being compared 
                here, so let's take a look at what they have to say:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    Infrastructure was traditionally provisioned using a combination of scripts and manual processes. 
                    Sometimes these scripts were stored in version control systems or documented step by step in text 
                    files or run-books. Often the person writing the run books is not the same person executing these 
                    scripts or following through the run-books. This results in the creation of new environments not 
                    always being repeatable, reliable, or consistent.
                    </p>
                    <cite>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                Being practical with your implementation of Infrastructure as Code means applying the same rigor of application 
                development to the resource provisioning done in the cloud. Typically, this is done through creating multi-stage 
                CI/CD pipelines to introduce automatic review with manual approval. Formatting and security linters, like 
                tflint and tfsec for Terraform, are amazing tools to ensure high level quality bars for the code you write 
                just like you would do with Java or Golang. All of this enables one to take a modularized approach to 
                infrastructure patterns so you can rubber-stamp what is deployed in your development, quality assurance, 
                and production environments.

                        <p>
                        An “AWS Native” Solution. Resources are written in text files using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
                        or Yet Another Markup Language (YAML). A CloudFormation template is deployed into the AWS environment 
                        as a "stack" of different resources.

                        An open-source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources. 
                        Enables you to model application infrastructure using TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET. Utilizes 
                        AWS CloudFormation in the background.

                        <p>
                        Serverless Framework is the one of the simplest way to develop infinitely scalable, pay-per-execution 
                        serverless applications. Manages your code as well as your infrastructure & supports multiple languages:
                        (Node.js, Python, Java, and more)                    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) allows for the concise descriptions of resources using blocks, 
                        arguments, and expressions. Extensible providers allow Terraform to manage a wide range of resources, 
                        including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, & hardware services.

                You can use a single CloudFormation template to create and update an entire environment or separate templates 
                to manage multiple layers within an environment. There are several options when it comes to managing stacks, 
                either through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, or AWS CloudFormation APIs. When 
                actualizing changes to infrastructure through CloudFormation, stacks typically go through changes in parallel 
                and steps have to be backed out manually if there are significant enough errors. When’s the right time to use 
                CloudFormation? When you want an 100% AWS Native Solution for maintaining the resources you deploy in your accounts  
                and are only trying to apply Infrastructure as Code principles to what you do inside AWS accounts. 
                CloudFormation isn't recommended when your applications don’t need programmatic access to granular deployment 
                tools to define their own processes. Here's an example of some CloudFormation code:

                <h3>Cloud Development Kit: Open-source SDK Framework</h3>

                <p>
                <img src="https://files.mitchelletzel.com/posts/IAC/IAC-article3-1000.png"

                Amazon provides the Cloud Development Kit as a way to more directly write custom application code in the 
                pre-existing language you're most comfortable with. By combining the basic building blocks of CDK code 
                together, you can quickly and easily create complex architectures for deployment. Where as automating 
                multiple phase deployments with JSON/YAML using CloudFormation can take some pretty custom logic, CDK 
                empowers developers to do more with less lines of code. When’s the right time to use Amazon's Cloud 
                Development Kit? If there is a custom application that you would like to programmatically integrate with 
                infrastructure deployments. Deployments should have granular phases that can allow for concepts like 
                automation and parallelization, otherwise this option becomes a little bit overkill. AWS also offers 
                pre-existing libraries of common infrastructure patterns in the AWS Construct Library.

                <h3>Serverless Framework: A Lambda First IaC Approach</h3>

                <p>
                The Serverless Framework is one of the simplest ways to develop infinitely scalable, pay-per-execution 
                serverless applications. This option easily manages your code as well as your infrastructure & supports 
                multiple languages: Node.js, Python, Java, and more. S.F. translates all of its syntax in serverless.yml 
                and packages your code into an AWS CloudFormation template so that it can automatically deploy them 
                together for you. It comes with a CLI that offers structure, automation and best practices out-of-the-box.
                When’s the right time to use the Serverless Framework? When there's a new application to write or a want
                to completely modernize old ones and you want a single tool to handle the software as well as the 
                infrastructure to support them.

                <h3>Terraform: A Multi-Cloud IaC Framework</h3>

                <p>
                <img src="https://files.mitchelletzel.com/posts/IAC/IAC-article4-1000.png"

                Terraform offers a consistent and reliable environment for infrastructure management and includes easy 
                but secure access to shared state and secret data as well as access controls for approving changes. Even 
                if the resources being managed are only in the AWS Cloud, Terraform can help to manage resources 
                CloudFormation can’t; e.g.: Postgres Schema inside AuroraDB on RDS. The real power comes from having a 
                single access point to managing resources in other Cloud providers like Azure, GCP, and Okta. Once an 
                application and all its environments are Terraform with proper CI/CD and active use it because practically 
                impossible to miss critical infrastructure changes or security risks. So when’s the right time to use 
                Terraform? Realistically, it's when your software has intricate use of several Cloud services, including 
                AWS, and you desire a single tool for multi-cloud deployments that easily replicate complex environments
                across several accounts.

                <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>

                <p>
                All of these tools are amazing entry points to managing your cloud infrastructure as code rather than a 
                series of manual process and possibly version-controlled scripts. I have used all of them in some sort 
                of professional setting with extensive experience using both Terraform and the Serverless Framework. 
                Each of them have their place and can bring positive additions to the processes they oversee. As usual 
                though, a tool is only as good as the person using it so it's up to the individual users to define what 
                their standards are and how they want to enforce them to actualize the changes they want to see. 
                Hopefully you've found this article as an interesting insight into the different ways to implement IaC 
                in your AWS, and possibly other, cloud environments.
