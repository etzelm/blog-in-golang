                I recently had the opportunity to explore the combined capabilities of the Go, Gin, and React libraries for an 
                interview assessment. This post is about that journey and the steps I've taken after its completion. If you 
                want to see the actual React page that was written for the assessment, you can find it hosted on this website 
                <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" href="/realtor" target="_blank">here</a></i>. You can also find the React source 
                code located in the same repository that is used for this website <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://github.com/etzelm/blog-in-golang" target="_blank">here</a></i>. </p>
                
                <p>
                The basis for the assessment was that I had approximately 8 hours to write a website for a theoretical realtor 
                company that allowed for two requirements, a secured user that could create, edit, and delete house listings and 
                an unsecured search feature for listings. The listings were given a pre-defined set of fields, including photos. 
                To accomplish this quickly I decided to use my pre-existing Go/Gin server to host a new React application that 
                uses an S3 bucket for image hosting and DynamoDB table to store the necessary information for each listing. The 
                state this article and the related website are in as you are reading this is not the same as it was when the 
                assessment was turned in.

                <h3>So Why These Libraries?</h3>
    
                <p>
                At this point you're probably wondering why I chose these particular libraries over similar ones that are 
                currently available. Largely this was decided by two factors, the first being my prior work experience with the 
                company I was interviewing with; which let me know that they like to use the React library for frontend 
                development. I should mention that the assessment made no mention of what tools to use to complete the 
                requirements. The second factor was that since I already had a Go/Gin server set-up that could handle proper 
                https traffic, I wanted to show case the skills necessary to maintain and improve such a setup. One of the nice 
                things I had pre-existing knowledge of, from a previous assessment, was that it is really easy to serve built 
                Javascript libraries from a Go/Gin server. Here is the one additional function needed to get the React to be 
                served from this existing website.
                </p>

    <pre><code>
    // LoadStaticFolderRoutes loads all api routes that serve a static server folder.
    func LoadStaticFolderRoutes(server *gin.Engine) *gin.Engine {
        server.Use(static.Serve("/public", static.LocalFile("./public", true)))
        server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
        server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/new", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
        server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/search", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
        server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/listing", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
        server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/my-listing", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
        server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/my-listings", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
        return server
    }
    </code></pre>

                <p>
                If at this point you are still not convinced that these were good choices, here are some general facts about 
                each language/library that should help close the gap that exists in convincing of you:

                <h3>Designing the React Components</h3>

                <p>
                HTML builds up a majority of the web applications everyone uses nowadays. React components allow us to wrap up 
                small sections of HTML and put them into individual classes with all the benefits of member variables and 
                functions; in Javascript. Most developers will understand when I say that Javascript is not the first language 
                college professors talk about when it comes to topics like Object Oriented Programming. When writing the website 
                for this assessment, I built all of the content into 10 unique components. You can find a general, grouped
                description of the components below:
                </p>

                <div class="row block-large-1-2 block-tab-full">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>App.js, Main.js, & NavBar.js.</h4>
                        <p>
                        This is the main starting point for all access to the react application, requests are funneled through 
                        here. Most login logic takes place here and the navbar attaches to this render function before the page 
                        router starts its real definition.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Tile.js & TileDeck.js.</h4>
                        <p>
                        These components are the base of root and search pages of the React app. TileDeck takes in an array of  
                        javascript objects and sends each one to a Tile to be displayed. One thing I hope to edit one day is the 
                        row/column based display order of the individual Tiles in a TileDeck.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Home.js & Search.js.</h4>
                        <p>
                        Both of these use Tile.js and TileDeck.js by making the same API call to the Go/Gin server and storing 
                        the array of javascript objects received back into their state so that it can be passed to the child 
                        components through their props. Search.js simply takes text input and does an exact match on state.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Listing.js, MyListing.js, and MyListings.js.</h4>
                        <p>
                        The three components here make up the add, edit, and delete capabilities of the realtor webpage I 
                        designed. MyListings.js uses Tile.js and TileDeck.js with conditional prop rendering to add special 
                        action buttons that can be seen above.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                Below, you can find a quote from Pete Hunt; one of the original members of the Facebook team that built 
                and open-sourced React:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    “Single-page applications” are all the rage these days. These are web pages that load once, and when 
                    the user clicks on a link or a button, JavaScript running on the page updates the address bar, but the 
                    web page is not refreshed. Management of the address bar is done by something called a router.
                    </p>
