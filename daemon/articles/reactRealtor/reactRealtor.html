                I recently had the opportunity to explore the combined capabilities of Go, Gin, and React for an interesting 
                interview assessment. This post is about that journey and the steps I've taken after its completion. If you 
                want to see the updated React page that was written for the assessment, you can find it hosted on my website 
                <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" href="/realtor" target="_blank">here</a></i>. You can also find the React source 
                code located in the same repository that is used for this website <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://github.com/etzelm/blog-in-golang" target="_blank">here</a></i>. </p>
                
                <p>
                The basis for the assessment was that I had approximately 8 hours to write a website for a theoretical realtor 
                company that allowed for two requirements, a secured user that could create, edit, and delete house listings and 
                an unsecured search feature for listings. The listings were given a pre-defined set of fields, including photos. 
                To accomplish this quickly, I decided to use my pre-existing Go/Gin server to host a new React application that 
                uses my S3 bucket, that's behind a CloudFront CDN and Route53 CNAME record, for image hosting and a DynamoDB table 
                to store the necessary information for each listing. The state this article and the related website are in as you 
                are reading this is not the same as it was when the assessment was turned in.

                <h3>So Why These Frameworks/Libraries?</h3>
    
                <p>
                At this point you're probably wondering why I chose these particular tools over similar ones that are 
                currently available. Largely this was decided by two factors, the first being my prior work experience with the 
                company I was interviewing with; which let me know that they like to use the React library for frontend 
                development. I should mention that the assessment made no mention of what tools to use to complete the 
                requirements. The second factor was that since I already had a Go/Gin server set-up that could handle proper 
                https traffic, I wanted to showcase the skills necessary to maintain and improve such a setup. One of the nice 
                things I had pre-existing knowledge of, from a previous assessment, was that it is really easy to serve built 
                Javascript libraries from a Go/Gin server. Here is the one additional function needed to get the React to be 
                served from this existing website.
                </p>

<pre><code>
// LoadStaticFolderRoutes loads all api routes that serve a static server folder.
func LoadStaticFolderRoutes(server *gin.Engine) *gin.Engine {
    server.Use(static.Serve("/public", static.LocalFile("./public", true)))
    server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
    server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/new", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
    server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/search", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
    server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/listing", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
    server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/my-listing", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
    server.Use(static.Serve("/realtor/my-listings", static.LocalFile("./realtor/build", true)))
    return server
}
</code></pre>

                <p>
                If at this point you are still not convinced that these were good choices, here are some general facts about 
                each one that should help close the gap that exists in convincing of you:
                </p>

                <h3>Designing the React Components</h3>

                <p>
                HTML builds up a majority of the web applications everyone uses nowadays. React components allow us to wrap up 
                small sections of HTML and put them into individual classes with all the benefits of member variables and 
                functions; in Javascript. Most developers will understand when I say that Javascript is not the first language 
                college professors talk about when it comes to topics like Object Oriented Programming. When writing the website 
                for this assessment, I built all of the content into 10 unique components. You can find a general, grouped
                description of the components below:
                </p>

                <div class="row block-large-1-2 block-tab-full">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>App.jsx, Main.jsx, & NavBar.jsx.</h4>
                        <p>
                        This is the main starting point for all access to the react application, requests are funneled through 
                        here. Most login logic takes place here and the navbar attaches to this render function before the page 
                        router starts its real definition.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Tile.jsx & TileDeck.jsx.</h4>
                        <p>
                        These components help make the root/search pages. TileDeck takes an array of JSON objects to send to 
                        Tiles for rendering. I want to improve the row/column based display order of the individual Tiles in a 
                        TileDeck.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Home.jsx & Search.jsx.</h4>
                        <p>
                        Both of these use Tile.jsx/TileDeck.jsx by making API calls to pass an array of JSON objects through 
                        their state and into the child components through props. Search.jsx takes text input and finds exact 
                        matches in state.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Listing.jsx, MyListing.jsx, and MyListings.jsx.</h4>
                        <p>
                        The three components here make up the add, edit, and delete capabilities of the listings. MyListing.jsx 
                        uses Bootstrap and an HTML Form, along with conditional rendering, to allow users to either add or edit 
                        listings.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p>
                Together, these components make up what is known as a single page application. Below, you can find a 
                quote about these types of applications from Pete Hunt; one of the original members of the Facebook 
                team that built and open-sourced React:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    “Single-page applications” are all the rage these days. These are web pages that load once, and when 
                    the user clicks on a link or a button, JavaScript running on the page updates the address bar, but the 
                    web page is not refreshed. Management of the address bar is done by something called a router.
                    </p>

                <h3>Was the Go/Gin really used?</h3>

                <p>
                Yes! Almost every modern frontend needs to make API calls to send and receive the necessary data 
                for their day to day operations. This assessment needed 4, 2 GET requests and 2 POST requests. The 
                GET requests either return all active listings in the database, including soft deletes, or a single 
                listing based on the MLS parameter passed to the API call. One POST request is for adding/modifying 
                listings and the other is for uploading images to the S3 bucket for public viewing. Thankfully with 
                this project's recent transition to go modules, it was really easy to refactor the organization of 
                the project's go code into more distinct files. Now there is one src folder with two sub-directories 
                containing the models and handlers for both my blog and the realtor website in independent files. 
                This is how easy writing APIs can be using Gin:
                </p>

<pre><code>
//ListingsGETAPI : Gets All Realtor Listings
func ListingsGETAPI(c *gin.Context) {
    c.Header("Cache-Control", "no-cache")
    listings := models.GetRealtorListings()

    // Call the JSON method of the Context to return the results
    c.JSON(200, listings)

}

//ListingGETAPI : Gets A Realtor Listing
func ListingGETAPI(c *gin.Context) {
    c.Header("Cache-Control", "no-cache")

    if listing := c.Param("listing"); listing != "" {

        card := models.GetRealtorListing(listing)

        // Call the JSON method of the Context to return the results
        c.JSON(200, card)

    } else {

        empty := []byte(``)

        // Call the JSON method of the Context to 404
        c.JSON(404, empty)

    }

}
</code></pre>

                <p>
                Hopefully now, as the reader, you are starting to understand how powerful Go, Gin, and React
                can be when used together; if the wielder has the right knowledge. I hope to do some follow-up 
                soon about things that can be done to improve this React project further. Topics might 
                include: eslint/linting, code styling, and testing. 
                </p>
