                I recently had the opportunity to explore the combined capabilities of the Go, Gin, and React frameworks for an 
                interview assessment. This post is about that journey and the steps I've taken after its completion. If you 
                want to see the actual React page that was written for the assessment, you can find it hosted on this website 
                <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" href="/realtor" target="_blank">here</a></i>. You can also find the React source 
                code located in the same repository that is used for this website <i><a style="color:#9C6708;" 
                href="https://github.com/etzelm/blog-in-golang" target="_blank">here</a></i>. The basis for the assessment was 
                that I had approximately 8 hours to write a website for a theoretical realtor company that allowed for two 
                requirements, a secured user that could create, edit, and delete house listings and an unsecured search feature 
                for listings. The listings were given a pre-defined set of fields, including photos. To accomplish this quickly 
                I decided to use my pre-existing Go/Gin server to host a new React application that uses an S3 bucket for image 
                hosting and DynamoDB table to store the necessary information for each listing. The state this article and the 
                related website are in as you are reading this is, is not the same as it was when the assessment was turned in.
