    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <h4>&emsp;&emsp;As a recent college grad, I decided to start this blog to help foster and 
        share my further eduction in the hopes that it might help others along a 
        similar journey. The goal is to hopefully dedicate this website to distributed systems 
        and things related to them as well.</h4>
